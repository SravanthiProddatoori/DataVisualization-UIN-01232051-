## R

The command below will load the tidyverse package.  If you have installed R, RStudio, and the tidyverse package, it should display a list of loaded packages and their versions.
```{r}

```

## R Markdown 

1. *Create a bulleted list with at least 3 items*

#### Data Visualization Exercises

1. (Q2) *How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?*

    There are 234 rows and 11 Columns
    
    ```{r}
    ggplot2::mpg
    ```

1. (Q4) *Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.*
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = hwy))
```


#### Workflow: basics Exercises

1. (Q2) *Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly (`library(tidyverse)` is correct):*

```r
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(dota = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)

filter(diamond, carat > 3)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

filter(mpg, cyl == 8)

filter(diamonds, carat > 3)
```


## Google Colab

1. *What are the URLs of your Google Colab notebooks (both Python and R)?*
Link of python : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14CRgYq7-XX-0F3dioL25te2j-51BSTkW?usp=sharing

Link of R : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gQVTWbjDrB5o9Zlg2MAbElX8_VInIor5?usp=sharing

## Tableau

*Insert your the image of your final bar chart here*

![Tableau!](\Users\p.sravanthi\Downloads\Pictures\Screenshots\Tableau.png)

1. *What conclusions can you draw from the chart?*

In the graph we can see that east area has greater phone sales whereas south has highest sales in machines. The profit is negative.


## Observable and Vega-Lite

### A Taste of Observable

1. *In the "New York City weather forecast" section, try replacing `Forecast: detailedForecast` with `Forecast: shortForecast`. Then press the blue play button  or use Shift-Return to run your change. What happens?*

If we replace the Forecast: detailedForecast with Forecast: shortForecast, if we run then it shows small details or description of the weather. For Example the description is changed to sunny.

1. *Under the scatterplot of temperature vs. name, try replacing `markCircle()` with `markSquare()`. Then press the blue play button  or use Shift-Return to run your change. What happens? How about `markPoint()`?*


If we try replacing markCircle() with markSquare() then the plots that were marked in circle will turn into square. If we change it into markPoint() then the square will turn into points.

1. *Under "Pick a location, see the weather forecast", pick a location on the map.  Where was the point you picked near?*

the longitude : -93   and lattitude: 102

1. *The last visualization on this page is a "fancy" weather chart embedded from another notebook.  Click on the 3 dots next to that chart and choose 'Download PNG'.  Insert the PNG into your report.*

### Charting with Vega-Lite

`markCircle()`

1. *Pass an option of `{ size: 200 }` to `markCircle()`.*

![circle1!](\Users\p.sravanthi\Downloads\Pictures\Screenshots\circle1.png)



1. *Try `markSquare` instead of `markCircle`.*

![square2!](\Users\p.sravanthi\Downloads\Pictures\Screenshots\sqaure2.png)

1. *Try `markPoint({ shape: 'diamond' })`.*

![diamond3!](\Users\p.sravanthi\Downloads\Pictures\Screenshots\diamond3.png)



`vl.x().fieldQ("Horsepower")`, ...

1. *Change `Horsepower` to `Acceleration`*

![ma1!](\Users\p.sravanthi\Downloads\Pictures\Screenshots\ma1.png)

1. *Swap what fields are displayed on the x- and y-axis*

![am2!](\Users\p.sravanthi\Downloads\Pictures\Screenshots\am2.png)

`vl.tooltip().fieldN("Name")`

1. *Change `Name` to `Origin`.*

When we change a name to origin country name is displayed when you move the curser on graph.


Another example, `count()`

1. *Remove the `vl.y().fieldN("Origin")` line.*

When we hover the curser on the graph we cannot see any label.

![countofrecords!](\Users\p.sravanthi\Downloads\countofrecords.jpeg)

1. *Replace `count()` with `average("Miles_per_Gallon")`.*

when we replace it with average we can see average("Miles_per_Gallon) of a particular country when we hover on it.
